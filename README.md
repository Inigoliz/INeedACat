# INeedACat
The cat shelter is a highly demanded place where the few offers of adoption for flat cats run in a matterr of hours.
In a desperate race to be the fastest one to book an appointment to get the cat, this bot can help.

A RaspberryPi has the solely mission to check the website of the shelter every few minutes and check if new kitties are looking for a home.
If that is the case, it will email me.

In order to use it, provide the following information in `config.yml`:
```yaml
sender_email: xxx@gmail.com
password: abc123
receiver_mail: zzz@zzz.com
receiver_mail2: zzz@zzz.com
```
